# Star-Wars-API
Showcase of Python and API calls

____

I an a huge Star Wars fan and I wanted to create a fun website to showcase my Python and JSON skills by having a user enter inputs and those inputs will provide an output that will be called from the Star Wars API site.

First, I used JSON to collect the names of the different characters, vehicles and planets from the Star Wars API website. There was an issue where the data was not in numerical order, so I had to go through and see what order the page numbers were in so there wouldn't be an error when calling the data.

Next, I created a series of questions where the selected answer will store a value in a variable and the final result will correlate to which character the user is, which vehicle they would use and which planet they would be from.

I won't show too much of the code here as to not spoil the questions.
